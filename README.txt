# Bayesian-Networks-Visualization
This course project is aim to visualize Bayesian Networks of standard machine learning dataset that predicts whether a person should play tennis or not based on weather

Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to build and visualize a Bayesian Network that models the probabilistic relationships between weather attributes and the decision to play tennis. The implementation and visualization are performed in Jupyter Notebook to allow step-by-step analysis, interactive exploration, and clear presentation of results.

Key Concepts:
• Bayesian Networks — Probabilistic graphical models representing relationships among random variables using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
• Inference — Predict unknown probabilities based on given evidence (e.g., “If outlook is 6 and 7, what’s the chance of playing tennis?”).

Technology used:
• Python 3
• Jupyter Notebook
• pgmpy – for building Bayesian Networks and performing inference
• pandas – for data preprocessing and handling
• matplotlib – for graph visualization
